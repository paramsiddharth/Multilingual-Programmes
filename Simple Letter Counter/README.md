# Simple Letter Counter

Takes a sentence (sequence of characters) as input&ast;, converts it to lowercase, and prints the frequency of each alphabet&ast;&ast; as follows:

E. g.  
**Input:**  
```Hello world!```  
**Output:**  
```
a -> 0
b -> 0
c -> 0
d -> 1
e -> 1
f -> 0
g -> 0
h -> 1
i -> 0
j -> 0
k -> 0
l -> 3
m -> 0
n -> 0
o -> 2
p -> 0
q -> 0
r -> 1
s -> 0
t -> 0
u -> 0
v -> 0
w -> 1
x -> 0
y -> 0
z -> 0
```

&ast;The input must be contained within single or double quotes in MATLAB. In PHP, input may be omitted and the sentence be stored in a variable instead.  
&ast;&ast;When made in MATLAB and R, the programme must also plot a graph of the frequency table.
