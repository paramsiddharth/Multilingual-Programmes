# Simple Letter Counter

Takes a sentence (sequence of characters) as input&ast;, converts it to lowercase, and prints the frequency of each alphabet&ast;&ast; as follows:

E. g.  
**Input:**  
Hello world!  
**Output:**  
a -> 0  
b -> 0  
c -> 0  
d -> 1  
e -> 1  
f -> 0  
g -> 0  
h -> 1  
i -> 0  
j -> 0  
k -> 0  
l -> 3  
m -> 0  
n -> 0  
o -> 2  
p -> 0  
q -> 0  
r -> 1  
s -> 0  
t -> 0  
u -> 0  
v -> 0  
w -> 1  
x -> 0  
y -> 0  
z -> 0  

&ast;The input must be contained within single or double quotes in MATLAB.  
&ast;&ast;When made in MATLAB, the programme must also plot a graph of the frequency table.
